# My Website - source code
The source code for my personal website. (the code at https://github.com/esfinkel/esfinkel.github.io is the post-processed React-generated build).

You can access the website itself at https://esfinkel.me.

My website was built in React and is hosted by GitHub Pages. It represents my competence with frontend technology and highlights my personal and professional interests and accreditations. It also showcases my past work in full-stack development and scripting.

## Packages
My website uses the following:
* `gh-pages` as a tool to deploy the website to GitHub Pages
* `react` and `react-dom` to use React
* `react-router-dom` to allow for a multi-page React app
* `react-bootstrap` and `react-latex` for the user interface
